# Non-Functional Requirements

This directory contains non-functional requirements covering performance, usability, compatibility, and technical standards.

## Overview

These requirements ensure the application meets quality standards for performance, usability, maintainability, and scalability.

## Categories

1. **[User Experience](./user-experience.md)** - UI/UX design and interaction standards
2. **[Performance](./performance.md)** - Loading times, rendering, and responsiveness
3. **[Browser Compatibility](./browser-compatibility.md)** - Supported browsers and devices
4. **[Technical Standards](./technical-standards.md)** - Code quality, testing, and development standards
5. **[Scalability](./scalability.md)** - Data volume handling and system growth
6. **[Security](./security.md)** - Data protection and user safety

## Key Non-Functional Principles

- **Engaging & Intuitive** - Modern, graphical user interface
- **Fast** - Quick load and render times with minimal client processing
- **Extensible** - Easy to add new dimensions and data sources
- **Maintainable** - Clear code structure and comprehensive testing
- **Scalable** - Support growing datasets and user base
